    USARSimRos is designed to provide a seamless interface between the USARSim framework (www.sourceforge.net/projects/usarsim) and ROS (www.ros.org).

USARSim provides embodyment (sensors and platforms) and environments for a physics-based robotic simulation while ROS provides leading edge control algorithms.

USARSimROS provides for auto-discovery of the simulated robots and sensors and connects these robots to the appropriate ROS control topics. Through the use of auto-discovery, robotic platforms and sensors may be easily changed and connect to the ROS control stack. Repeatable experiments are possible in a variety of environments and will hopefully lead to more robust and capable algorithms.
